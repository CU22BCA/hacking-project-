    <h1>üìò About This Info Disclosure Lab</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Info Disclosure Lab! This challenge is designed to help you understand and identify common vulnerabilities that can lead to the unintentional exposure of sensitive information in web applications. By exploring the scenarios presented in this lab, you'll gain practical experience in recognizing these flaws and understanding their potential impact.</p>
    <p>In this lab, you will be looking for various ways that information might be unintentionally revealed. These can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comments in the HTML or other code that contain sensitive data or hints.</li>
        <li>Sensitive data present in log files that are inadvertently made accessible.</li>
        <li>Information revealed through misconfigured server endpoints that expose internal details or functionality.</li>
        <li>Backup files or other artifacts left in accessible locations that might contain confidential information.</li>
        <li>Error messages that reveal internal system details or paths.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember the tips provided on the main page to guide your exploration:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="important">Check HTML comments:</span> Always inspect the source code of web pages, as developers sometimes leave notes or even sensitive information within the comments.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Check logs:</span> Server logs can sometimes contain valuable information, including details about requests, errors, and potentially sensitive data. Look for accessible log files.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Check endpoints:</span> Explore different URLs and functionalities of the web application. Sometimes, unexpected or administrative endpoints can be accessed, revealing more than intended.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This lab is a simplified scenario to illustrate these common vulnerabilities. In real-world applications, information disclosure can be more subtle and might require a combination of techniques to uncover.</p>
    <p>Your goal is to identify any instances where sensitive information is unintentionally exposed. Use the clues provided and your investigative skills to find the hidden secrets!</p>
    <p>Good luck with the challenge, and happy hunting!</p>
